This is a dirty hack to solve a problem I had in a Linguistic Field Methods class: being able to parse a bunch of form-meaning pairs with naive substring matching.

Not the most elegant solution, but I had to minimize the time I spent working on this and maximize the time I spent producing my 50-page grammar of Arapesh. (Phew!)
