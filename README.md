This is a dirty hack to solve a problem I had in a Linguistic Field Methods class: being able to parse a bunch of form-meaning pairs with naive substring matching.

Not the most elegant solution, but I had to minimize the time I spent working on this and maximize the time I spent producing my 50-page grammar of Arapesh. (Phew!)

For more information, as well as my product from this course, see the [sister repository](https://github.com/lgessler/ldg3fa-grammar-of-arapesh).
